# Develop: Story and plot elements

You will now write a fictional, yet _**plausible**_ story that describes how this imagined future 30 years from now came to be. For example, Unicorns are not plausible to exist in 30 years \(unless you make a compelling CRISPR argument\), but autonomous flying cars are plausible.

## Requirements

* **Content:** The result of the plot must be of a positive future.
* **Plausible:** The story must be in the realm of technological and scientific plausibility.

Who are the organizers, supporters, proponents, and opponents? These people are your characters. Read the [character topic](/topics/character.md) for more details.
9. **Plot structure**
