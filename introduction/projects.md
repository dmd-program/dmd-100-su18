# Projects

DMD 100 has three projects, one in user experience and interface prototyping, interactive storytelling, and open product design. These are difficult projects and have been divided into achievable deliverables that follow the Double Diamond design process.

## Submitting projects

When project tasks are completed, they are submitted to [ELMSLN Studio](https://studio.aanda.psu.edu/dmd100/cle/app/projects). A class-wide space, called [Open Studio](https://studio.aanda.psu.edu/dmd100/cle/open-studio), displays ongoing work by your peers mimicking a physical art or design studio environment.
