# Designing Time

Designing Time \(p.166 - 177 \) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin

## Writing prompt

He also speaks about contrast being the differentiator between designing one's time and managing one's time. Grudin again reflects on his "intentional" day and what it actually means to be intentional.

You are the new hire and are asked to propose to your boss how they might incorporate some activity into the workplace that fulfills the need for delight, inspiration, or energy. What would you propose?
